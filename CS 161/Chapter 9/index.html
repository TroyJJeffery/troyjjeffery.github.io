            Had to edit to make ratings exclude zero.

        <li><h3>Exercise 9.7</h3></li>

            <img src="Images/E.9.8.png" alt="" width=50%>
            the findMostHelpfulComment method is working correctly.  The number 5 was the highest rated 

        <li><h3>Exercise 9.9</h3></li>
            <img src="Images/E.9.9.png" alt="" width=50%>
            
        <li><h3>Exercise 9.10</h3></li>
            Fixed the inclusivity of zero problem for ratings and the non randomized nature of comment selection.<br>
            I don't see why the changes we made would effect anything else in the code.<br>

        <li><h3>Exercise 9.11</h3></li>

                ok

        <li><h3>Exercise 9.21</h3></li>
            ****Part of 9.5 which we are skipping****

        <li><h3>Exercise 9.22</h3></li>
            <img src="Images/E.9.22.png" alt="" width=50%>
            <br>
            Not really.

        <li><h3>Exercise 9.23</h3></li>
            I'm getting both 1 and 7.  The description says the test is 3+4, so that's bad.
            <img src="Images/E.9.23.png" alt="" width=50%>

        <li><h3>Exercise 9.24</h3></li>
            No, it's results also seem to vary between two numbers.

        <li><h3>Exercise 9.25</h3></li>
            For some reason he has his operators after his applyPreviousOperator method.  These values need their positions swapped.

        <li><h3>Exercise 9.26</h3></li>
            <img src="Images/E.9.26.png" alt="" width=50%>

        <li><h3>Exercise 9.27</h3></li>
            Not really.  I really don't like the if/else there.  Also, instead of clearing the left operand itself <b>
            there should really be a method to do that.
        

        <li><h3>Exercise 9.28</h3></li>
            <img src="Images/E.9.28.png" alt="" width=50%>
            <br>
            previousOperator has not been reset.  This is going to cause his next add/subtract to be calculated<br>
            with the previousOperator (in this case +).  If he tries to subtract, he's gonna have a bad time.

        <li><h3>Exercise 9.29</h3></li>
            Make the clear() method set all values to default.<br>
            Instead of relying only on previousOperator, have a current operator variable.<br>
            Have the testAll() method randomly generate numbers to test with and have them shown in the system.out<br>
            Change the if else to an if/else if/else so more functions can be added.<br>


        <li><h3>Exercise 9.30</h3></li>
            <img src="Images/E.9.30.png" alt="" width=50%>

        <li><h3>Exercise 9.31</h3></li>
                ok

        <li><h3>Exercise 9.32</h3></li>
            <img src="Images/E.9.32.png" alt="" width=50%>
            <br>
            Lol not really.  But I were to tell a doctor every single thing about my body it wouldn't<br>
            be helpful for a diagnosis.

        <li><h3>Exercise 9.33</h3></li>
            It's way to much.  Why are we adding print statements when we don't need them?

        <li><h3>Exercise 9.34</h3></li>
             A manual walkthrough can help you if you are just totally lost and have no idea what's going on.<br>
            Print statements can help you if there's a specific place your code isn't working and you need to identify where.

        <li><h3>Exercise 9.35</h3></li>
                <img src="Images/E.9.35.png" alt="" width=50%>

        <li><h3>Exercise 9.36</h3></li>
                    I did it but without posting my entire code it's hard to prove I guess.<br>
                    Mine's really simple and def needs work to be considered complete but it does work simply.
