        <li><h3>Exercise 3.1</h3></li>
            <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pRy-UVy9pCpZ6_Fh2BEqdwl328bte8zc46yuw3ECCyM/edit?usp=sharing">Google Sheets Drawing.</a><br>
            A class is like a bone structure that dictates parameters the objects it spawns are created with.<br>
            An object takes all of it's parameters from it's parent class.  From there it takes values which set it apart from<br>
            other objects that are spawned from the parent class.

        <li><h3>Exercise 3.2</h3></li>
            Class diagrams can change as more objects are spawned from the class.<br>
            Or as the class begins to have more dependencies to other classes.

        <li><h3>Exercise 3.3</h3></li>
            An object's diagram could change as it becomes "used" or attached to other Classes <br>
            I imagine as well, that there are methods that relate two objects. <br>
            In this context something like a parameter "classmates" would create a list with other people in the LabClass <br>

        <li><h3>Exercise 3.4</h3></li>
            public Instructor (boolean isTutor)<br>
            tutor = isTutor;

        <li><h3>Exercise 3.5</h3></li>

        <li><h3>Exercise 3.6</h3></li>
            if(minutes == 0)
                hour =+ 1

        <li><h3>Exercise 3.7</h3></li>
            <img src="Images/E.3.7.png" alt="" width=30%>

        <li><h3>Exercise 3.8</h3></li>
            Error: non-static method getValue() cannot be referenced from a static context

        <li><h3>Exercise 3.9</h3></li>
            Error: '.class' expected
            So the issue is with the (int 5).  I'm guessing that when you put a data type there it thinks you are asking <br>
            for an input.  Since we're calling on a accessor of an object we can't make a new variable on the variable.

        <li><h3>Exercise 3.10</h3></li>
            So it appears that nothing happens.  This isn't ideal because the end user doesn't know what's happened and will assume it's broken.<br>
            I think that either one of two solutions could be implemented.  I'm guessing the one that the book wants to use is to <br>
            set an error message and let the user know what the value range is.<br>
            <br>
            A second solution is: Why does our end user need to set the time with an exact value anyway?  It seems like a good way <br>
            to allow things to break.  Most clocks now just allow the user to easily manipulate the increment mutator. <br>
            I think that would be a good solution here.


        <li><h3>Exercise 3.11</h3></li>
            It would consider 0 outside the range of acceptable inputs.

        <li><h3>Exercise 3.12</h3></li>
            It would require only one condition to be true.<br>
            It would open the inputs to only require a number 0 or greater OR a number less than the limit.<br>
            The range now is no range at all as it allows any int, no matter the value.

        <li><h3>Exercise 3.13</h3></li>
            <pre>
                ! false = true
                not false = true

                (34 != 33) && ! false = true
                (true) && not false = true
            </pre>

        <li><h3>Exercise 3.14</h3></li>
        <pre>
            a && b

            a _ b___Outcome
            0 | 0 | true
            1 | 0 | false
            0 | 1 | false
            1 | 1 | true
        </pre>              

        <li><h3>Exercise 3.15</h3></li>
            <pre>
            a && ! b

            a__b____Outcome
            0 | 0 | false
            1 | 0 | true
            0 | 1 | true
            1 | 1 | false
            </pre>

        <li><h3>Exercise 3.16</h3></li>
        <pre>    
            a == b

            a _ b___Outcome
            0 | 0 | true
            1 | 0 | false
            0 | 1 | false
            1 | 1 | true
        </pre>

        <li><h3>Exercise 3.17</h3></li>
        <pre>
            It would need another condition for each multiple of 10 the number has.<br>
            ex. 10^0 = 1 ----No need for a condition here as you won't need a placeholder zero
                10^1 = 10 --- You will need a condition if minutes < 10
                10^2 = 100---- Now you will need a condition for min < 100 and min < 10
        </pre>
        <li><h3>Exercise 3.18</h3></li>
            Those two statements should be equivalent.

        <li><h3>Exercise 3.19</h3></li>
            It's only a little surprising.  Java doing it's best to predict how we'll be using the tool assumes<br>
            that if the first two things it encounters are numbers, then we probably want it to add the int's <br>
            On the other hand, starting with a String let's java know that we're going to be using concatenation<br>
            so right off the bat it assumes everything's a string.
