        <li><h3>Exercise 3.1</h3></li>
            <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pRy-UVy9pCpZ6_Fh2BEqdwl328bte8zc46yuw3ECCyM/edit?usp=sharing">Google Sheets Drawing.</a><br>
            A class is like a bone structure that dictates parameters the objects it spawns are created with.<br>
            An object takes all of it's parameters from it's parent class.  From there it takes values which set it apart from<br>
            other objects that are spawned from the parent class.

        <li><h3>Exercise 3.2</h3></li>
            Class diagrams can change as more objects are spawned from the class.<br>
            Or as the class begins to have more dependencies to other classes.

        <li><h3>Exercise 3.3</h3></li>
            An object's diagram could change as it becomes "used" or attached to other Classes <br>
            I imagine as well, that there are methods that relate two objects. <br>
            In this context something like a parameter "classmates" would create a list with other people in the LabClass <br>

        <li><h3>Exercise 3.4</h3></li>
            public Instructor (boolean isTutor)<br>
            tutor = isTutor;

        <li><h3>Exercise 3.5</h3></li>
            <img src="Images/E.3.5.png" alt="" width=50%>

        <li><h3>Exercise 3.6</h3></li>
            if(minutes == 0)
                hour =+ 1

        <li><h3>Exercise 3.7</h3></li>
            <img src="Images/E.3.7.png" alt="" width=50%>

        <li><h3>Exercise 3.8</h3></li>
            Error: non-static method getValue() cannot be referenced from a static context

        <li><h3>Exercise 3.9</h3></li>
            Error: '.class' expected
            So the issue is with the (int 5).  I'm guessing that when you put a data type there it thinks you are asking <br>
            for an input.  Since we're calling on a accessor of an object we can't make a new variable on the variable.

        <li><h3>Exercise 3.10</h3></li>
            So it appears that nothing happens.  This isn't ideal because the end user doesn't know what's happened and will assume it's broken.<br>
            I think that either one of two solutions could be implemented.  I'm guessing the one that the book wants to use is to <br>
            set an error message and let the user know what the value range is.<br>
            <br>
            A second solution is: Why does our end user need to set the time with an exact value anyway?  It seems like a good way <br>
            to allow things to break.  Most clocks now just allow the user to easily manipulate the increment mutator. <br>
            I think that would be a good solution here.


        <li><h3>Exercise 3.11</h3></li>
            It would consider 0 outside the range of acceptable inputs.

        <li><h3>Exercise 3.12</h3></li>
            It would require only one condition to be true.<br>
            It would open the inputs to only require a number 0 or greater OR a number less than the limit.<br>
            The range now is no range at all as it allows any int, no matter the value.

        <li><h3>Exercise 3.13</h3></li>
            <pre>
                ! false = true
                not false = true

                (34 != 33) && ! false = true
                (true) && not false = true
            </pre>

        <li><h3>Exercise 3.14</h3></li>
        <pre>
            a && b

            a _ b___Outcome
            0 | 0 | true
            1 | 0 | false
            0 | 1 | false
            1 | 1 | true
        </pre>              

        <li><h3>Exercise 3.15</h3></li>
            <pre>
            a && ! b

            a__b____Outcome
            0 | 0 | false
            1 | 0 | true
            0 | 1 | true
            1 | 1 | false
            </pre>

        <li><h3>Exercise 3.16</h3></li>
        <pre>    
            a == b

            a _ b___Outcome
            0 | 0 | true
            1 | 0 | false
            0 | 1 | false
            1 | 1 | true
        </pre>

        <li><h3>Exercise 3.17</h3></li>
        <pre>
            It would need another condition for each multiple of 10 the number has.<br>
            ex. 10^0 = 1 ----No need for a condition here as you won't need a placeholder zero
                10^1 = 10 --- You will need a condition if minutes < 10
                10^2 = 100---- Now you will need a condition for min < 100 and min < 10
        </pre>
        <li><h3>Exercise 3.18</h3></li>
            Those two statements should be equivalent.

        <li><h3>Exercise 3.19</h3></li>
            It's only a little surprising.  Java doing it's best to predict how we'll be using the tool assumes<br>
            that if the first two things it encounters are numbers, then we probably want it to add the int's <br>
            On the other hand, starting with a String let's java know that we're going to be using concatenation<br>
            so right off the bat it assumes everything's a string.


        <li><h3>Exercise 3.20</h3></li>
            The modulo operator (%) returns the remainder of division between two integers.

        <li><h3>Exercise 3.21</h3></li>
            8 % 3 = 2(3) r 2 = 8 <br>
            8 % 3 returns 2

        <li><h3>Exercise 3.22</h3></li>
            A negative sign in the numerator returns a negative answer.<br>
            A negative sign in the denominator seems to have no effect.<br>

        <li><h3>Exercise 3.23</h3></li>
            0, 1, 2, 3, 4

        <li><h3>Exercise 3.24</h3></li>
            0 to (m-1)

        <li><h3>Exercise 3.25</h3></li>
            The increment method takes the variable "value" and set's it equal to it's value plus one.<br>
            Then it divides by the limit and returns the remainder<br>

        <li><h3>Exercise 3.26</h3></li>
            <pre>
            if (value/limit < 1)
                {
                    value =+ 1;
                }
            else
                {
                    value = 0;
                }
            </pre>
            <br>
            Well the modulo operator certainly allows for less lines of code.

        <li><h3>Exercise 3.27</h3></li>
            <img src="images/E.3.27.png" alt="" width=50%>
            <br>
            I think it's because since no value was set it defaults to zero?

        <li><h3>Exercise 3.28</h3></li>
            <img src="images/E.3.28.png" alt="" width=50%>

        <li><h3>Exercise 3.29</h3></li>
            60 times or use the setTime muator method.

        <li><h3>Exercise 3.30</h3></li>
            private Rectangle window(int width, int length)

            window = new Rectangle(5, 10)

        <li><h3>Exercise 3.31</h3></li>
            The second constructor allows the user to set a specific time instead of starting at 0:00.

        <li><h3>Exercise 3.32</h3></li>
            It's in the method setTime that takes the two variables and puts them in the right format.<br>
            This method is called as part of the second constructor.

        <li><h3>Exercise 3.33</h3></li>
           <ul>
                <li>p1.print(page7, false)</li>
                <li>p1.print(CODE, true)</li>
            <br>
                <li>p1.getStatus(9)</li>
                <li>p1.getStatus(5)</li>
            </ul>

        <li><h3>Exercise 3.34</h3></li>
            <pre>
                    wall = new Square();
                    window = new Square();
                    roof = new Triangle();  
                    sun = new Circle();
                    sun2 = new Circle();
                    person = new Person();
            </pre>

        <li><h3>Exercise 3.35</h3></li>
            <pre>
                    roof.changeSize(60, 180);
                    roof.moveHorizontal(20);
                    roof.moveVertical(-60);
                    roof.makeVisible();

            </pre>

        <li><h3>Exercise 3.38</h3></li>
            Ok, I solved this problem by
            <ol>
                <li>Adding a parameter to the NumberDisplay - boolean militaryTime</li>
                <li>Made this a required parameter for NumberDisplay creation</li>
                <li>Changed the getDisplayValue method by adding an if/else statement checking for the value isMilitary</li>
                <li>If isMilitary is true, no change.  If isMilitary is false, removed the placeholder 0 adder.</li>
                <li>On the ClockDisplay class, using the ClockDisplay() constructor I added a required parameter twelveHourClock</li>
                <li>If this value is true, it changes the default value given to the hour NumberDisplay to 12 and sets it's boolean to false.</li>
                <li>If this value is false, the NumberDisplay will make as if no changes were made.</li>
            </ol>

        <li><h3>Exercise 3.39</h3></li>
                Uh, both those ways are for pansies.  Clocks should be able to choose how they tell time.

        <li><h3>Exercise 3.40</h3></li>
        <pre>    
            public class Tree

                private Square trunk;
                private Triangle leaves;

                public Tree()
                {
                    trunk = new Sqaure;
                    leaves = new Triangle;

                }

                public void Setup()
                {
                    trunk.moveVertical(-50)

                }
                </pre>

        <li><h3>Exercise 3.41</h3></li>
                added above

        <li><h3>Exercise 3.42</h3></li>
                <img src="images/E.3.42.png" alt="" width=50%>

        <li><h3>Exercise 3.43</h3></li>
        <pre>
                mailClie1 <--> mailServ1 <--> mailClie2
        </pre>

        <li><h3>Exercise 3.44</h3></li>
            <img src="images/E.3.44.png" alt="" width=50%>

        <li><h3>Exercise 3.45</h3></li>
            <img src="images/E.3.45.png" alt="" width=50%>

        <li><h3>Exercise 3.46</h3></li>

        <li><h3>Exercise 3.47</h3></li>
            I think it will go to the next line down?  <br>
            Then it goes down one more line...<br>
            Then one more...<br>
            This one dorps to the end because the last line completed the method (the lines in between did not execute in the program)

        <li><h3>Exercise 3.48</h3></li>
            It stops before the line executes and the executes the line when you click step.

        <li><h3>Exercise 3.49</h3></li>
            So the step into command actually takes us to the method that's referenced<br>
            Once there, each step executes line by line.  In this case it prints each line as we take a step<br>
            If we don't use the step in command it seems like it stops at the method but doesn't execute it?

        <li><h3>Exercise 3.50</h3></li>

        <li><h3>Exercise 3.51</h3></li>
            The MailServer stores MailItem's.<br>
            These items are both initially created by/sent and then received by MailClients.

        <pre>
            MailClient creates MailItem --> stored in MailServer.
            MailClient requests MailItem <----- MailServer gives any mail for that user.
        </pre>

        <li><h3>Exercise 3.52</h3></li>
            Well, no new insights really.  It checks each line and lets you know the variables involved.<br>
            Super useful, not super complicated.

                new Screen(xRes, yRes)

        </pre>

        <li><h3>Exercise 3.56</h3></li>
            My clockDisplay constructor would need to create an additional numberDisplay with a limit of 60.<br>
            The timeTick method would need to be updated to add a seconds increment, including a rollover statement<br>
            Both the setTime and updateDisplay methods would need to be updated to add seconds as well.

        <li><h3>Exercise 3.57</h3></li>
            <img src="images/E.3.57.png" alt="" width=50%>

        <li><h3>Exercise 3.58</h3></li>
            I don't really see why not.  If we set the lowest value to increment and then set conditional if statements to check<br>
            for 0 values until it increments the highest value.  But hey, I'm dumb and it's late so who knows.

        <li><h3>Exercise 3.59</h3></li>
        <pre>
            public NumberDisplay(int rollOverLimit,boolean isMilitary)
            {
                limit = rollOverlimit;
                militaryTime = isMilitary;
                value = 0;
            }

            public NumberDisplay(int rollOverLimit)
            {
                limit = rollOverLimit;
                value = 0;
                master = NumberDisplay;
                militaryTime = false;
            }

            public void next()
            {
                if(value < limit){
                    value =+ 1;
                }
                if(value == limit){
                    value = 0;
                    master.next();
                }
            }
        </pre>
        <br>
        <br>
        So hopefully this code would allow you to assign your hours display first, and choose whether or not it's in military time.<br>
        Then, you would choose the second numberDisplay constructor and assign the display before it as it's "master".<br>
        You would set the ClockDisplay to only increment the lowest NumberDisplay and the NumberDisplay's would do the rest. <br>
