6. In the hash table map implementation, the hash table size was chosen to be 101. If the
table gets full, this needs to be increased. Re-implement the put method so that the table
will automatically resize itself when the loading factor reaches a predetermined value
(you can decide the value based on your assessment of load versus performance).
